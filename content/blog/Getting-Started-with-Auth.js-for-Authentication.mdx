# Getting Started with Auth.js for Authentication

Authentication is a crucial part of modern web applications. **Auth.js** (formerly NextAuth.js) is a powerful and flexible authentication library that seamlessly integrates with Next.js applications. It simplifies handling user sign-ups, logins, and sessions with support for various providers like Google, GitHub, and custom email/password systems.

Auth.js stands out due to its ease of integration and flexibility. It supports multiple authentication providers like OAuth (Google, GitHub, Twitter) and also allows custom credentials login (email/password). It handles session management automatically and can be customized to suit different authentication needs. Let’s explore how you can get started with Auth.js in your Next.js project.

## Setting Up Authentication with Providers

Auth.js makes it simple to use third-party authentication providers. Here’s an example of setting up GitHub as a provider:

```js
import { Auth } from 'next-auth';
import GitHubProvider from 'next-auth/providers/github';

export default Auth({
  providers: [
    GitHubProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
    })
  ]
});

```

You can also add other providers like Google, Twitter, and more, or combine different providers.

## Session Handling

Auth.js provides a simple and secure session management system. By default, it uses cookies to manage sessions, and you can choose between server-side sessions or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for a stateless approach.

Here’s how you can configure it to use JWT-based session management:

```js
const options = {
  session: {
    jwt: true
  }
};

```

This ensures that session data is stored in a secure and stateless manner, perfect for scalable applications.

## Using Custom Credentials for Authentication

If you want more control over how users authenticate, you can use custom credentials, such as email and password, for login. Auth.js allows you to set up a custom login handler where you verify users manually.

Here’s an example of how you can set up a custom credentials provider:

```js
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';

export default Auth({
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: 'Credentials',
      credentials: {
        username: { label: "Username", type: "text" },
        password: { label: "Password", type: "password" }
      },
      authorize: async (credentials) => {
        const user = { id: 1, name: 'User', email: 'user@example.com' };
        if (credentials.username === 'user' && credentials.password === 'password') {
          return user;
        }
        return null;
      }
    })
  ]
```

## Custom Redirects
You can customize the flow of redirects after login or logout to provide a smoother user experience:

```js
callbacks: {
  async redirect({ url, baseUrl }) {
    return url.startsWith(baseUrl) ? url : baseUrl;
  }
}
```
## API Integration

Auth.js integrates perfectly with Next.js API routes, making it easy to add authentication middleware to your API endpoints. For instance, you can protect an API route using the getSession function:

```js
import { getSession } from 'next-auth/react';

export default async (req, res) => {
  const session = await getSession({ req });
  if (session) {
    res.send({ content: 'This is protected content.' });
  } else {
    res.send({ error: 'You must be logged in to access this content.' });
  }
};

```

## Getting Started with Auth.js
To get started with Auth.js in your Next.js project, follow these steps:

### Install Auth.js
You can install Auth.js via npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install next-auth
 ```

### Configure Providers
Set up your authentication providers by creating a file at pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js. You can include providers like Google or GitHub, as well as email/password-based systems.

### Protect Routes
Use getSession to protect pages or API routes by checking if the user is authenticated before granting access.

### Start Your Application
Run your application with the development server to start testing your authentication setup.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion
Auth.js simplifies the often complex world of user authentication, allowing you to focus on building your application instead of worrying about managing sessions, tokens, or secure authentication flows. Whether you're building a small personal project or a large-scale application, Auth.js offers a flexible, secure solution for handling user authentication.

Happy coding!
