# An Introduction to Next.js: The React Framework for Production

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build production-ready web applications with features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. Whether you're creating a personal blog or a full-scale enterprise application, Next.js provides the flexibility and tools to meet your needs.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js stands out in the React ecosystem for several reasons:

### 1. **Performance and Optimization**
   Next.js optimizes performance out of the box. With features like image optimization and built-in caching, your site runs fast without the need for manual tuning.

### 2. **SEO-Friendly**
   With server-side rendering and static site generation, Next.js helps search engines crawl your pages more effectively, giving your site an SEO boost compared to traditional React apps.

### 3. **API Routes**
   You can build backend APIs alongside your frontend using Next.js API routes. This feature makes it easier to manage both client and server logic in one project.

### 4. **File-based Routing**
   Next.js uses a file-based routing system. This means that any file you create in the `pages` directory automatically becomes a route.

### 5. **Static and Dynamic Content**
   Next.js provides two primary methods for delivering content: Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR). This allows for flexible data fetching based on your needs.

## Key Features

### 1. **Pre-rendering**
   By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means it generates HTML for each page in advance, improving performance and SEO.

   - **Static Generation**: Pre-renders pages at build time.
   - **Server-Side Rendering**: Pre-renders pages on each request.

### 2. **API Routes**
   Create full-stack applications with API routes. No need for a separate server; you can handle form submissions, authentication, or database operations directly within Next.js.

```js
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, Next.js!' });
}
```
